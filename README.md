# Project Reboot: Universal Fortnite GameServer
### FYI: This isn't 100% universal, there are bugs on almost every season and some seasons have no support at all.<br> <a href="https://discord.com/invite/42pXp7Wqtf">Discord Server</a>.

# Supported Versions
Todo: 3.5-4.5, S5-S6<br>
Possibly Add: S12-S15<br>
Currently Supported: S7-S9<br>

# PLANS

Add an auto pattern finder, this is in development and it's easy to make, it's just time consuming.<br>
Add Chapter 2 Support<br>
Clean up Project and add comments to the code.<br>
# CURRENT ISSUES

Not using beacons causes no ReplicationDriver.<br>
S10 (10.40) has a movement issue + Event crashes<br>
Battle Bus Crashes on ~S8+<br>

Code is everywhere.<br>
Console Colors are a 50/50.<br>
