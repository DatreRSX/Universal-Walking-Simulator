# "Universal" Walking Simulator
## Firstly, this isn't universal, there are many bugs on each season. I hope to add more versions in the future. <br>This supports S3.5-S9.

# PLANS

I want to add an auto pattern finder, this is in development, it's easy to make, it's just time consuming.<br>
Possibly add abilities, this will require a bit more patterns unfortunately.<br>
I need to do some more testing to add inventory.<br>
Building is easy, but requires inventory.<br>

# CURRENT ISSUES

Not using beacons causes no ReplicationDriver.<br>
S5-S6 fix is very scuffed (I just reimplemented NotifyControlMessage).<br>

Code is everywhere.<br>
Console Colors are a 50/50.<br>
